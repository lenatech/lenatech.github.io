Being frustrated with the preparation of an upcoming event, I decided to review my time being a DjangoGirls contributor and collect ideas while filing them up.

> Hi! My name is Aimee and this is my N-th Djangogirls Workshop... <br />

This was always my opening when I introduced myself at the workshop. I still remembered that last time after [@keimlink](https://twitter.com/keimlink) said it was his X-th Djangogirls Workshop, I started to count which number should I put into my N here. Today, I just realized that I have been here for a while and it will be my 10th Djangogirls Workshop soon!!!! 🎉

So, I decided to write them down before struggling with the N again:

> On this Journey, you are not alone!<br />

Four years ago, I came to Germany to improve my German and pursue my study. Comparing to where I am from, Germany is such a large country. I didn't know where to meet new people and immerse in the local culture. What only came to my mind was: Djangogirls.

I searched for Djangogirls groups in Germany and saw there would be a workshop in Leipzig. I wrote to [@DjangoGirlsLE](https://twitter.com/DjangoGirlsLE) and asked if I could contribute as a coach for them. [@allerleiPzig](https://twitter.com/allerleiPzig) and [@Friede5Friede](https://twitter.com/Friede5Friede), both amazing women I know from Leipzig, gave me a warm welcome. Soo after, I have already coached there for three times.

In these workshops, I have met a lot of amazing people in every gender, every color. Everytime, when I returned back from the workshop, I felt energetic and I appreciated every people who made these happened. I especially enjoyed the diversity in each workshop from different cities to different countries all over the world.

> Each one, teach one.<br />

In this community, I saw former djangogirls attendee becoming coaches and sharing their experience in different places. When I first attended, I didn't think about taking part in 8+ workshops. The first time I became a coach, I was terrified to be not good enough. But thanks to the community who gave me supports whenever I needed.

> The journey has not ended yet!<br />

I don't know when and where will be my 10th workshop, but I am sure that I will keep writing my pages and share my love of coding in this society.
